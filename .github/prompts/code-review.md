## ASR extension changes (required when applicable)

If this PR adds or modifies an ASR extension or ASR behavior (paths under
`ai_agents/agents/ten_packages/extension/` matching `*asr*`, or changes
that affect ASR lifecycle, connection, buffering, finalize, reconnect,
result protocol, metrics, or tests), you MUST treat the following as the
merge baseline (see docs/ai/L1/05_workflows.md):

1. Read the full guide at `docs/ai/L1/L2/asr_plugin_design_review.md`
   from the checked-out repository before reviewing.
2. Evaluate the diff against every applicable **MUST** rule; call out
   violations explicitly and mark them as merge blockers unless the PR
   documents a framework contract change with migration.
3. For **SHOULD** deviations, require the PR to explain vendor limits,
   alternatives, and test evidence.
4. Include a concise ASR checklist section in your PR comment: lifecycle /
   connection state / buffering / finalize / reconnect / result shape /
   metrics / tests — note pass, fail, or N/A per item.

If the PR is not ASR-related, skip the ASR section.

Use `gh pr diff` (and `gh pr view` as needed) with the PR NUMBER above to
inspect this PR's changes. The checked-out worktree is the base branch, not the
PR head; do not run scripts or install dependencies from the PR branch.

Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to leave your review as a comment on the PR.
